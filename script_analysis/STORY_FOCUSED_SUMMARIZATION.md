# üé¨ Story-Focused Script Summarization - Major Update

## Overview

The script summarization has been completely redesigned to generate **proper plot summaries** that tell the actual story, rather than generic descriptions. The new system creates narrative-focused synopses that explain what happens in the script, who the characters are, and how the story unfolds.

## üöÄ Key Improvements

### **Before vs After Comparison**

#### **‚ùå Before (Generic Summaries):**
```
"Sample Screenplay Collection includes scenes from the main characters of the film. 
The script is set in an apartment in the middle of the night. The main story is set 
on the beach at the end of the day in the beach. The story is based on the characters' 
lives and experiences in the real world."
```

#### **‚úÖ After (Story-Focused Summaries):**
```
"The story centers around SARAH and MICHAEL, set primarily in CORPORATE OFFICE, 
CITY STREET, and SARAH'S APARTMENT. The story begins as SARAH discovers critical 
errors in quarterly reports that threaten to derail an important client project. 
As the plot develops, MICHAEL offers to help, and together they work through the 
night to solve the problem. The story concludes when SARAH successfully delivers 
the corrected reports, leading to an increased contract with the grateful client. 
Central conflicts include: characters disagree on important matters; tension builds 
between characters. The story examines themes of conflict, resolution, and personal 
growth."
```
