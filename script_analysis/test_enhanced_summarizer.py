    INT. CORPORATE OFFICE - DAY
    
    SARAH sits at her desk, reviewing documents. The office buzzes with activity around her. She looks frustrated and stressed.
    
    SARAH
    (frustrated, to herself)
    These numbers don't add up! Someone made a serious mistake here. The client is going to be furious.
    
    MICHAEL enters, carrying two cups of coffee. He notices Sarah's distress.
    
    MICHAEL
    Morning, Sarah. Rough start to the day?
    
    SARAH
    (worried)
    The quarterly reports are all wrong. We're going to have to recalculate everything, and we might miss our deadline.
    
    MICHAEL
    (concerned, sitting down)
    How bad is it? Can I help?
    
    SARAH
    (grateful)
    It's pretty bad. I need to call the client and explain the delay. But first, I need to figure out what went wrong.
    
    MICHAEL
    (determined)
    Let's work on this together. We'll get it done.
    
    EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
    
    Rain pours down as SARAH walks quickly toward her car. Her phone rings urgently.
    
    SARAH
    (into phone, stressed)
    Yes, I understand the urgency. I'll have the corrected reports by tomorrow morning. I promise.
    
    She gets into her car and drives away into the stormy night.
    
    INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT
    
    SARAH sits at her laptop, working frantically. Coffee cups and papers surround her. She looks exhausted but determined.
    
    SARAH
    (to herself, tired but focused)
    This has to be perfect. The client is counting on us, and I can't let them down.
    
    Her phone buzzes with a text message. She reads it and smiles for the first time that day.
    
    SARAH
    (reading message, relieved)
    "Found the error in the data source. Sending corrected files now. We've got this!" - Michael
    
    SARAH
    (to herself, grateful)
    Thank you, Michael. I couldn't have done this without your help.
    
    She continues working, more confident now. The storm outside begins to clear.
    
    INT. CORPORATE OFFICE - NEXT MORNING
    
    SARAH arrives at the office, looking much more relaxed. MICHAEL is already there.
    
    MICHAEL
    (smiling)
    Good morning! Did you finish the reports?
    
    SARAH
    (proudly)
    Yes! Thanks to your help, the client was thrilled with the results. They actually increased our contract.
    
    MICHAEL
    (happily)
    That's fantastic! Teamwork really does make the dream work.
    
    SARAH
    (grateful)
    I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you for believing in me when I was ready to give up.
    
    They share a warm smile as the morning sun streams through the office windows.
